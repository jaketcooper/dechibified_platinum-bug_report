Everything was fine, until I hit the elite 4. I decided to switch from Calem to Calem Championship. I replaced the files exactly as directed, it was pretty easy. Upon loading into game, everything seemed okay.

Then I opened my trainer card on accident, I saw my updated model T posed and the game froze. Music was still playing, no crash, but also no movement on the screen. Only sign the game was still running was the music. Ryujinx itself was fine, it was just the game that was frozen. No logs, no console output, just nothing but music.

So I reset, didn't open my trainer card, no big deal. I bought some items, went back to the pokemon league, then started the elite 4.

On the first fight, I got through the dialog, the portraits for myself and the bug guy showed, then the screen faded to white (to switch to the battle arena)

It was just stuck here. The same issue as with the trainer card. Music played, no input/graphics/logs.
